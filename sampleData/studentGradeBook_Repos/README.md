Sample student grade repositories. Each `studentX_gradebook.md` file from `0_out` will be placed into its corresponding directory with the command, `../src/gradeAlert.py -p`. The pairing for the files and their directories is contained in the pairing file, `pairings.txt`.

Note, the above command finds the program` gradeAlert.py` in the `scr/` directory.
